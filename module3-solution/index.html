						<p>
							Chicken has well-documented health benefits, but different parts and preparation methods factor into how healthy your chicken-based meal turns out. Darker cuts like the thigh and drumstick contain higher caloric content than lighter cuts like the breast. Keeping the skin or frying chicken will also add saturated fat.
							
							If you’re switching out red meat for chicken, you’ll want to stick with chicken breast, as it’s the healthiest cut of the bird.
							
							Health Benefits
							Chicken makes a fantastic substitute for red meats. A great source of protein, the meat has been linked to a variety of health benefits:
							
							Stronger Bones and Muscles
							
							The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids. Our bodies use amino acids to build muscle tissue, something that is particularly important as we age. Studies have also shown that higher protein intake helps to maintain bone mineral density. Eating chicken can help to build stronger muscles and promote healthier bones, decreasing the risk of injuries and diseases such as osteoporosis.
							
							Weight Management and Heart Health
							
							Research suggests that 25-30 grams of protein per meal can help us feel more full. Protein rich meals can make us feel fuller despite us eating less, which helps to promote better weight management. Healthier weight leads to improvements in risk factors for heart problems such as high triglyceride levels and high blood pressure. A food rich in protein, chicken can help with weight management and reduce the risk of heart disease.
							
							Better Mood
							
							Chicken contains the amino acid tryptophan, which has been linked to higher levels of serotonin (the “feel good” hormone) in our brains. The tryptophan levels in chicken aren’t high enough to make you feel instantly euphoric, but studies show it could help to boost serotonin levels when paired with other factors.
